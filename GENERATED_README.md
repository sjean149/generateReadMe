## License
Similar to the MIT license, the ISC version is a permissive license. It could be described as a ‘stripped-down’ version of the MIT license as it removes some of the language and jargon that some people consider unnecessary. While the language has been changed or removed, it operates on the same functional level as its MIT ‘cousin.’
        Like the MIT license, the ISC license has only two requirements for anyone who modifies a program. The first is that anyone who alters the software has to include the original license. The second is that they must include a copy of the license itself when they copy or modify the original licensed code in any new version. Organizations that use the software under an ISC license can use any new code commercially.
